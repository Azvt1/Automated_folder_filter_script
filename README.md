CODE PURPOSE:
It takes a source folder containing unorganized files and a destination folder where you want to organize them.
For each file in the source folder, it extracts the file type.
It creates a subfolder in the destination folder for each file type.
It moves each file to its corresponding subfolder based on file type and appends a unique identifier to prevent overwriting.

To run the code you just need python to be installed on your device.
